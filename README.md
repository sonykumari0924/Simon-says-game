# Simon-says-game

A fun and interactive Simon Says Memory Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The game tests your memory by showing a sequence of blinking colors that you must repeat in the correct order.
Each correct round increases the level and adds a new color to the pattern.

🚀 How the Game Works

▶ Start the Game

Press any key on your keyboard to start.

The game will blink a random colored box (Red, orange, Blue, or green).

▶ Follow the Sequence

You must click the boxes in the same order as they blinked.

Each level adds one new color to the existing sequence.

If you click the wrong color → Game Over

A message appears

Press any key again to restart
